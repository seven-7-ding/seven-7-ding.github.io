<!-- # Finally, I decided to connect with the world. -->
## A simple story about my 2025

At the end of 2025, I reflected on my journey in the past year. As usual, I found myself underwent impressive experiences, met distinct people, and gained novel insights for my life. I accomplished the first research work independently, got to know many outstanding seniors, and attended the first international AI conference, all with the help of Prof. Ma (words really failed me to express my thankfulness to him🥹). I was also lucky enough to meet Prof. Pan and got the offer, and had a wonderful summer intern. I ...
        
"Seven, then what is the most important turing point for you that happened in 2025?" I asked myself, anticipating myself to say "well, I can hardly say A is more important than B since they are all crucial for me".
        
However, surprisingly, something clicked in my mind. Actually, for me, 2025 was the year that I started to **connect myself with the world** after I finally **found and defined "me" for myself**. I refer to "connecting with the world" as the process of conciously learning about the external world, and actively do something for people around me. I became concerned about social issues, the priciples behind different events, and what I can do to make a difference for others, even just for a tiny space around me.

## Is this really different?

You would probably think, "well, everyone connects with the world. I read news, watch videos, chat with friends, make money for my family and work for our country, ... So why does 'connecting with the world' matter so much to you?"

Acutally, what I meant by "connecting with the world" is more than just interacting with the external world. The point is, I started to <u>*shift my eyes from myself to the world*</u>. I hope to be in a state, where I become truly curious about the rules of our society instead of only eager to be up-to-date; I really think in my friends' shoes when chatting with them instead of just want to express my own opinions or confirm our friendships; I finally agree that doing something for the external world is not only an obligation exerted by the external world itself, but also the only way (?) to define my value, my meaning in life, my destiny, or whatever you want to call it😇.

***It is worth mentioning that the above shift has not been accomplished yet, and is not the necessary way for everyone.***

Then, the question becomes, "how to connect with the world"? I recalled the wonderful bloggign sites by <a class="in-text-link" href="https://lilianweng.github.io/">Lilian Weng's blog</a> and <a class="in-text-link" href="https://spaces.ac.cn/me.html">BoJone's blog</a>, where they could share all kinds of insights and projects with the world.

"Yes, this is exactly what I want!" I thought.

## What am I going to share with the world?

I'm not sure about all the possible topics I'll post in the future, but there are some initial ideas:

* **Insights about AI research**, including my personal understandings of research topics in this field.

* **Projects and findings**, including my personal projects, and some interesting experiments I did.

* **Ideas about life**, including my thoughts about my life, my interpretation about some "wisdoms" from books or peoples, etc.

* **Understandings about social issues**, including my perspectives about some social phenomena, some reflections about social problems, etc.
