## I'm not so confident...🫥

> I have things to say because I believe that I know them well. I define "confidence" as this.

From now and then, "confidence" just pops into my mind. 

For example, when I was trying to figure out the topic for my **2nd** blog post, I found that what I should make clear first is actually "what I am confident about".

- I am majored in AI, but I am not absolutely confident about AI, even its specific subfields like RL.😇

- I love dramas and operas, but I certainly know too little about them.🎶

And when I'm chatting, I often feel nervous and afraid when I don't know much about the topic being discussed.

## Behind confidence. 

### Why are we not confident?

> Inconsistency and misalignment between "what I'm supposed to know" and "what I really know".

Last time, I was eating out with a friend. We began with complains about our toilsome work, and followed by our plans for the winter vacation. Then, the topic shifted to <u>anecdotes about students in FDU</u>, which I care little about. After listening for a while (with polite nods and "aha"), I finally gave up and frankly said, "I really have no idea about that hahaha, so do you know what kind of fish are we eating now?"🥹

It is natrual to feel unconfident when we know little about something that others are good at, especially when we think that we "should" know about it in order to feel accepted, or simply to keep the conversation going.

And it is even worse when other people know much more than we do about topics that are raised by us, because we feel obliged to "be professional" in this domain.

### Why I want confidence?

> The contract between ourselves and others for smooth communication.

If I try to look deeper into this, I'd like to summarize the reason for our pursuing confidence as the **consistency and alignment between "what I'm supposed to know" and "what I really know".** I pursue such consistency in my inner mind, even when not talking with another person, because I'll naturally imagine the potential interactions with others (anticipatory anxiety); and in both anticipatory and real interactions, I try to maintain the consistency of my <u>**Self-Presentation**</u>. 

Further, The last point, consistent self-presentation, could be attributed to the two-way contract between ourselves and others, that we want to keep the communication smooth and avoid awkward situations.

So, in short, the reasons are:

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
want fluent conversation ↔ want consistent self-presentation</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> ⇒ want consistency between ``what I'm supposed to know" and ``what I really know"</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> ⇒ want confidence</h3>


🔗*Please refer to <a href="https://monoskop.org/File:Goffman_Erving_The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life.pdf">Presentation of Self</a> theory proposed by Erving Goffman!* And I think that this topic worth further discussions.

## After we know the reasons...

> What is your goal?

To this end, if I get unconfortable for my lack of confidence, such as feeling nervous for not knowing the anecdotes about FDU students, or feeling eagerly to learn more about AI, dramas, operas, etc., I have clear items to think about:

* Does a fluent conversation with him/her really matter to me, and worth the cost of pursuing confidence?

* Does my consistent self-presentation really matter?

* Does my appearing familiar to the topic really matter to me/others?

* Am I really interested in this topic, or does this topic brings me spiritual/material benefits?

After being frank to myself, I can make my choice more easily. Moreover, I'm much less overwhelmed between "I shall know it" and "I'm not so interested in it".

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Now, please be frank to yourself!💪</h2>
