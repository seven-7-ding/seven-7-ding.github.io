<p>Hi!🍹 I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at Fudan University, majoring in Aritificial Intelligence. And I'm going to pursue my Ph.D. degree at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) starting from Fall 2026, advised by <a href="https://ling-pan.github.io/">Prof. Ling Pan</a>👸.</p>
<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>My interests lie mainly in understanding intelligent decision-making systems <b>from the bottom level</b>, with a focus on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>🤖the mathematical foundations of <u>reinforcement learning</u>, and their connections to real-world applications;</li>
    <li>🔢understanding the behaviors of complex models and algorithms from the lens of <u>complex architectures</u>;</li>
    <li>🛡️designing and analyzing <u>Trustworthy AI Systems</u>, including robustness, fairness, and interpretability.</li>
</ul>
